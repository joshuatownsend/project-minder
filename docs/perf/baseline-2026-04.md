# Performance Baseline — 2026-04-30

This file records measurements taken **before** the performance overhaul. Each later phase appends a section comparing against this baseline. Do not edit the baseline section once captured — it is the reference point.

> **Reproducibility note** — Project Minder is itself a local-only "filesystem-as-database" tool that scans `C:\dev\*` (or any configured `devRoot`) for projects and reads `~/.claude/projects/` for Claude Code session data. Paths in this doc that look local-specific (`~/.claude/...`, `C:\dev\*`, `~/.claude/plans/...`) describe the **input dataset** the dashboard ran against — they are not required inputs anyone else needs to reproduce on their machine, and they will differ per user. The plan that motivates these measurements is summarized in PR #33's description and the commit message; the canonical full version lives in the author's local plan file. To recapture the baseline on a different machine, run the helpers in this directory (`bundle-summary.mjs`, `api-bench.sh`) against your own dev server and dataset — the headline numbers will differ, but the methodology is portable.

## 1. `next build` — Route bundle sizes

Captured with `npm run build` from a clean state. First-load JS bytes per route extracted from `.next/diagnostics/route-bundle-stats.json` (Turbopack writes per-route chunk lists there). Re-run with `node docs/perf/bundle-summary.mjs .` after each phase.

**Per-route first-load JS (uncompressed, KB):**

| Route | KB |
|---|---|
| `/` | 719.5 |
| `/project/[slug]` | 668.7 |
| `/config` | 596.6 |
| `/setup` | 586.6 |
| `/agents` | 585.1 |
| `/skills` | 585.1 |
| `/sessions/[sessionId]` | 585.0 |
| `/sessions` | 581.1 |
| `/usage` | 581.0 |
| `/templates/[slug]` | 578.7 |
| `/status` | 575.4 |
| `/manual-steps` | 574.0 |
| `/commands` | 573.8 |
| `/stats` | 573.3 |
| `/insights` | 570.4 |
| `/templates` | 566.7 |
| `/_not-found` | 560.9 |

**Shared baseline (loads on every route, 8 chunks):** 560.9 KB
- 222.2 KB `0n~dq4kpx9xxx.js` (largest — likely React + Next.js runtime + barrel imports)
- 146.0 KB `0257pdz1-imal.js`
- 53.4 KB `0gbimfcp5mgcy.js`
- 43.4 KB `0ul5g4mscv3cn.js`
- 36.1 KB `0zofgg56w22f0.js`
- 26.3 KB `04mz01vofiqe_.js`
- 23.2 KB `0bzupvr5gt3k9.js`
- 10.3 KB `turbopack-1709eij3q9cpp.js`

**Total first-load chunks (union across routes):** 1,087.1 KB uncompressed.
**Largest single route:** `/` at 719.5 KB.
**Largest shared chunk:** 222.2 KB.

Build also emits a Turbopack tracing warning that the whole project gets traced from `next.config.ts` → `claudeConversations.ts` → `/api/sessions` route — flag for follow-up (not in P0 scope but cheap to fix).

## 2. API endpoint timings

Captured with `bash docs/perf/api-bench.sh` after a fresh `npm run dev` startup (no prior API hits). Cold = first hit. Warm = second hit immediately after. Cold timings include full JSONL parse / project scan; warm timings hit the in-memory TTL caches.

| Route | Cold (s) | Warm (s) | Bytes | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/sessions` | **7.97** | 0.024 | 916 KB | session header parse across 3,211 JSONL files |
| `/api/usage?period=week` | **6.90** | 0.014 | 12 KB | parseAllSessions + aggregator (1.1 GB JSONL) |
| `/api/projects` | **2.73** | 0.034 | 1.6 MB | 12 sub-scanners × 60+ projects |
| `/api/manual-steps` | **1.96** | 0.013 | 107 KB | filesystem walk for MANUAL_STEPS.md |
| `/api/stats` | 0.98 | 0.014 | 2.9 KB | scanAllProjects + claudeConversations |
| `/api/agents` | 0.85 | 0.015 | 350 KB | parseAllSessions + loadCatalog (warm-shared with /api/skills) |
| `/api/skills` | 0.10 | 0.034 | 649 KB | (effectively warm — shared `__usageParserCache` from /api/agents) |
| `/api/insights` | 0.09 | 0.034 | 1.1 MB | filesystem walk for INSIGHTS.md |
| `/api/git-status` | 0.05 | 0.012 | 2.6 KB | returns cached snapshot, enqueues background |

**Key observations:**
- Cold p95 is **~8 s** (sessions). Cold loads of `/sessions` and `/usage` pages each trigger this. The 2-min TTL on `parseAllSessions` means a user idle for >2 min eats the full 7-s pause on next nav.
- The bottom four routes (skills/insights/agents/stats) are fast because `parseAllSessions()` was warmed by an earlier route's hit — confirms one canonical shared parser would collapse the cold cost.
- Response payload sizes are large: `/api/projects` 1.6 MB, `/api/insights` 1.1 MB, `/api/sessions` 916 KB. Even on warm cache, the client parses these synchronously on the main thread.

**Server memory after one API benchmark sweep:**
- Main dev process (PID 29576): **1,543 MB RSS / 1,712 MB private**, 1,609 handles
- Next.js worker (PID 63992): 551 MB RSS / 565 MB private, 559 handles
- Combined ~2.1 GB. Idle baseline before sweep was not captured (would need a separate cold start) — recapture in P0.

## 3. Performance traces — LCP, CLS, render delay

Captured via Chrome DevTools MCP `performance_start_trace` with `reload: true`. Each row is one fresh page load with the dev server's API caches in a warm-ish state (the API benchmark in §2 had run just before, so `parseAllSessions()` was cached). Cold-cache loads would be much worse — see the cold timings in §2.

Saved traces (loadable in Chrome DevTools):
- `docs/perf/trace-home.json`
- `docs/perf/trace-sessions.json`
- `docs/perf/trace-usage.json`
- `docs/perf/trace-stats.json`

| Page | LCP (ms) | TTFB (ms) | Render delay (ms) | CLS | Notable insights |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | **3,905** | 183 | 3,722 | 0.04 | RenderBlocking · DOMSize · NetworkDependencyTree |
| `/sessions` | **3,060** | 80 | 2,980 | **0.53 (poor)** | ForcedReflow · DOMSize · CLSCulprits |
| `/usage` | 352 | 232 | 121 | 0.04 | Skeleton renders fast — but **API was warm**; real cold load = 6.9 s wait for data |
| `/stats` | 962 | 77 | 885 | 0.04 | DOMSize |

**Key observations:**
- Render delay dominates LCP on `/` (3.7 s) and `/sessions` (3.0 s). TTFB is fine. The pain is JS execution + render after the document arrives — that's the "all pages are 'use client'" cost.
- `/sessions` CLS is **0.53** — well into the "poor" range (>0.25). The ungrouped, unvirtualized session list reflows aggressively as data lands.
- `/usage` LCP looks fast (352 ms), but the metric reflects only the skeleton — the actual data takes the full `/api/usage` round-trip (6.9 s cold) before the dashboard renders. This is a known LCP pitfall with client-side fetch patterns.
- Forced-reflow flagged on `/sessions` — a client-side render hot spot.

### Lighthouse (snapshot mode) — `/sessions`

Lighthouse run via `mcp__chrome-devtools__lighthouse_audit` with `mode: snapshot, device: desktop`. Snapshot mode only audits accessibility, best practices, SEO (performance is covered by the traces above).

- Accessibility: **96**
- Best Practices: **100**
- SEO: **100**
- 1 audit failed (likely color-contrast detail — not the focus here)

Reports: `docs/perf/report.html`, `docs/perf/report.json`

## 4. Browser memory & idle network

### Memory snapshot — `/sessions`

Captured via Chrome DevTools MCP `take_memory_snapshot` after the page settled. Snapshot saved to `docs/perf/sessions-page.heapsnapshot` (load in Chrome DevTools → Memory tab to inspect retainers).

- Heap nodes: **1,003,921**
- Heap edges: **4,546,918**
- Snapshot file size: **79.5 MB** (live JS heap is roughly 15–25 MB; the file format is verbose)

Order-of-magnitude reading: a healthy SPA at idle sits around 5–10 MB heap / 200–400 K nodes. `/sessions` is in the high range because it renders every session row across every project at once (no virtualization). Expect P0 virtualization to drop nodes by a large multiple.

### Idle network on `/usage` — captured over ~46 s of trace + ~65 s of polling activity

Trace saved to `docs/perf/trace-idle-30s.json`. CLS during the idle window: 0.00 (good — no layout shifts when data is stable). The interesting signal is the network panel:

**28 fetch/xhr requests captured during the idle window** (no user interaction, page just sitting):

| Endpoint | Hits | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/manual-steps/changes?since=…` | 12 | `NotificationListener` — 5 s interval |
| `/api/status` | 8 | `AppNav` — 10 s interval |
| `/api/manual-steps?pending=true` | 3 | `AppNav` — 30 s interval |
| `/api/usage?period=month` | 2 | `/usage` page hooks |
| `/api/projects` | 1 | `/usage` page hooks |
| Other | 2 | `/api/manual-steps?pending=true` repeats |

Roughly **one request every 2.3 seconds while the user is idle** on a single page. Three pollers fire forever, paused only when the user closes the tab. None pause on `document.hidden`.

This is the foundation for P0's "consolidate idle pollers" work — collapsing three intervals into one `useDashboardPulse` hitting `/api/pulse` and pausing on hidden should cut idle requests by ~75 %.

## 5. Bundle hygiene snapshot

For comparison after P0's lucide tree-shake. Captured by counting raw imports + on-disk dependency sizes.

- Files importing `from "lucide-react"`: 45
- Files importing `from "date-fns"`: 5 (corrected — date-fns IS used; the original audit was wrong)
- `next.config.ts` `modularizeImports` rule: **not present**
- `node_modules/` total: **608 MB**
- `node_modules/lucide-react/` on-disk: **44 MB** (the ESM tree contains every icon as a separate module — without `modularizeImports`, icons that aren't used still pull in the barrel)
- `node_modules/date-fns/` on-disk: **32 MB**
- `node_modules/@radix-ui/` on-disk: 1.8 MB (lean, no concern)

---

## 6. Headline summary — what the numbers say

The audit conclusions in the perf-overhaul plan are now backed by measurements:

| Concern | Measured baseline | Validates |
|---|---|---|
| Cold API parses are slow | `/api/sessions` 7.97 s, `/api/usage` 6.90 s, `/api/projects` 2.73 s | P1 mtime cache, P2 SQLite indexer |
| Warm cache works fine | All routes < 50 ms warm | TTL caches do their job — but expire frequently |
| Server memory pressure | **1.54 GB RSS** for the dev process after one nav cycle | P2 indexer + memory-bounded SQL beats keeping 1.1 GB JSONL parsed in RAM |
| Pages render slowly | LCP 3.9 s on `/`, 3.1 s on `/sessions` | P3 RSC + streaming |
| Layout thrash | `/sessions` CLS = 0.53 (poor) | P0 virtualization + skeleton on `/sessions` |
| Idle dashboards are noisy | 28 fetch/xhr requests in ~65 s of idle, three independent pollers | P0 consolidate pollers, P3 SSE replaces polling |
| Bundle weight | 561 KB shared on every route, 720 KB on `/`, 45 files barrel-import lucide | P0 `modularizeImports` for lucide |
| Heap on big lists | 1.0 M nodes, 4.5 M edges on `/sessions` | P0 virtualization |

The dashboard `/` and `/sessions` pages are the two biggest sources of pain. `/usage` looks deceptively fast on warm cache but eats a 6.9-second wait for fresh data.

## How to recapture after each phase

After landing each phase (P0/P1/P2/P3), append a new section to this file titled `## After P<n> — <date>` with the same tables filled in fresh, then add a final `### Delta vs baseline` subsection with percentage changes. Do not edit the baseline tables above — they are frozen as the reference point.

### Recapture commands

```bash
# 1. Build + bundle sizes
npm run build
node docs/perf/bundle-summary.mjs .

# 2. API timings — start dev server fresh, then
bash docs/perf/api-bench.sh

# 3. Server memory — while server idle after sweep
# (Windows PowerShell)
# Get-Process node | Sort-Object -Descending WorkingSet | Select-Object Id, @{N='RSS_MB';E={[math]::Round($_.WorkingSet/1MB,1)}}

# 4. Performance traces + memory snapshot — Chrome DevTools MCP
#   navigate_page → performance_start_trace (reload:true) → traces saved per page
#   take_memory_snapshot on /sessions
#   list_network_requests after a 30 s idle on /usage
```
