# Performance Baseline — 2026-04-30

This file records measurements taken **before** the performance overhaul. Each later phase appends a section comparing against this baseline. Do not edit the baseline section once captured — it is the reference point.

> **Reproducibility note** — Project Minder is itself a local-only "filesystem-as-database" tool that scans `C:\dev\*` (or any configured `devRoot`) for projects and reads `~/.claude/projects/` for Claude Code session data. Paths in this doc that look local-specific (`~/.claude/...`, `C:\dev\*`, `~/.claude/plans/...`) describe the **input dataset** the dashboard ran against — they are not required inputs anyone else needs to reproduce on their machine, and they will differ per user. The plan that motivates these measurements is summarized in PR #33's description and the commit message; the canonical full version lives in the author's local plan file. To recapture the baseline on a different machine, run the helpers in this directory (`bundle-summary.mjs`, `api-bench.sh`) against your own dev server and dataset — the headline numbers will differ, but the methodology is portable.

## Environment

## 1. `next build` — Route bundle sizes

Captured with `npm run build` from a clean state. First-load JS bytes per route extracted from `.next/diagnostics/route-bundle-stats.json` (Turbopack writes per-route chunk lists there). Re-run with `node docs/perf/bundle-summary.mjs .` after each phase.

**Per-route first-load JS (uncompressed, KB):**

| Route | KB |
|---|---|
| `/` | 719.5 |
| `/project/[slug]` | 668.7 |
| `/config` | 596.6 |
| `/setup` | 586.6 |
| `/agents` | 585.1 |
| `/skills` | 585.1 |
| `/sessions/[sessionId]` | 585.0 |
| `/sessions` | 581.1 |
| `/usage` | 581.0 |
| `/templates/[slug]` | 578.7 |
| `/status` | 575.4 |
| `/manual-steps` | 574.0 |
| `/commands` | 573.8 |
| `/stats` | 573.3 |
| `/insights` | 570.4 |
| `/templates` | 566.7 |
| `/_not-found` | 560.9 |

**Shared baseline (loads on every route, 8 chunks):** 560.9 KB
- 222.2 KB `0n~dq4kpx9xxx.js` (largest — likely React + Next.js runtime + barrel imports)
- 146.0 KB `0257pdz1-imal.js`
- 53.4 KB `0gbimfcp5mgcy.js`
- 43.4 KB `0ul5g4mscv3cn.js`
- 36.1 KB `0zofgg56w22f0.js`
- 26.3 KB `04mz01vofiqe_.js`
- 23.2 KB `0bzupvr5gt3k9.js`
- 10.3 KB `turbopack-1709eij3q9cpp.js`

**Total first-load chunks (union across routes):** 1,087.1 KB uncompressed.
**Largest single route:** `/` at 719.5 KB.
**Largest shared chunk:** 222.2 KB.

Build also emits a Turbopack tracing warning that the whole project gets traced from `next.config.ts` → `claudeConversations.ts` → `/api/sessions` route — flag for follow-up (not in P0 scope but cheap to fix).

## 2. API endpoint timings

Captured with `bash docs/perf/api-bench.sh` after a fresh `npm run dev` startup (no prior API hits). Cold = first hit. Warm = second hit immediately after. Cold timings include full JSONL parse / project scan; warm timings hit the in-memory TTL caches.

| Route | Cold (s) | Warm (s) | Bytes | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/sessions` | **7.97** | 0.024 | 916 KB | session header parse across 3,211 JSONL files |
| `/api/usage?period=week` | **6.90** | 0.014 | 12 KB | parseAllSessions + aggregator (1.1 GB JSONL) |
| `/api/projects` | **2.73** | 0.034 | 1.6 MB | 12 sub-scanners × 60+ projects |
| `/api/manual-steps` | **1.96** | 0.013 | 107 KB | filesystem walk for MANUAL_STEPS.md |
| `/api/stats` | 0.98 | 0.014 | 2.9 KB | scanAllProjects + claudeConversations |
| `/api/agents` | 0.85 | 0.015 | 350 KB | parseAllSessions + loadCatalog (warm-shared with /api/skills) |
| `/api/skills` | 0.10 | 0.034 | 649 KB | (effectively warm — shared `__usageParserCache` from /api/agents) |
| `/api/insights` | 0.09 | 0.034 | 1.1 MB | filesystem walk for INSIGHTS.md |
| `/api/git-status` | 0.05 | 0.012 | 2.6 KB | returns cached snapshot, enqueues background |

**Key observations:**
- Cold p95 is **~8 s** (sessions). Cold loads of `/sessions` and `/usage` pages each trigger this. The 2-min TTL on `parseAllSessions` means a user idle for >2 min eats the full 7-s pause on next nav.
- The bottom four routes (skills/insights/agents/stats) are fast because `parseAllSessions()` was warmed by an earlier route's hit — confirms one canonical shared parser would collapse the cold cost.
- Response payload sizes are large: `/api/projects` 1.6 MB, `/api/insights` 1.1 MB, `/api/sessions` 916 KB. Even on warm cache, the client parses these synchronously on the main thread.

**Server memory after one API benchmark sweep:**
- Main dev process (PID 29576): **1,543 MB RSS / 1,712 MB private**, 1,609 handles
- Next.js worker (PID 63992): 551 MB RSS / 565 MB private, 559 handles
- Combined ~2.1 GB. Idle baseline before sweep was not captured (would need a separate cold start) — recapture in P0.

## 3. Performance traces — LCP, CLS, render delay

Captured via Chrome DevTools MCP `performance_start_trace` with `reload: true`. Each row is one fresh page load with the dev server's API caches in a warm-ish state (the API benchmark in §2 had run just before, so `parseAllSessions()` was cached). Cold-cache loads would be much worse — see the cold timings in §2.

Saved traces (loadable in Chrome DevTools):
- `docs/perf/trace-home.json`
- `docs/perf/trace-sessions.json`
- `docs/perf/trace-usage.json`
- `docs/perf/trace-stats.json`

| Page | LCP (ms) | TTFB (ms) | Render delay (ms) | CLS | Notable insights |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | **3,905** | 183 | 3,722 | 0.04 | RenderBlocking · DOMSize · NetworkDependencyTree |
| `/sessions` | **3,060** | 80 | 2,980 | **0.53 (poor)** | ForcedReflow · DOMSize · CLSCulprits |
| `/usage` | 352 | 232 | 121 | 0.04 | Skeleton renders fast — but **API was warm**; real cold load = 6.9 s wait for data |
| `/stats` | 962 | 77 | 885 | 0.04 | DOMSize |

**Key observations:**
- Render delay dominates LCP on `/` (3.7 s) and `/sessions` (3.0 s). TTFB is fine. The pain is JS execution + render after the document arrives — that's the "all pages are 'use client'" cost.
- `/sessions` CLS is **0.53** — well into the "poor" range (>0.25). The ungrouped, unvirtualized session list reflows aggressively as data lands.
- `/usage` LCP looks fast (352 ms), but the metric reflects only the skeleton — the actual data takes the full `/api/usage` round-trip (6.9 s cold) before the dashboard renders. This is a known LCP pitfall with client-side fetch patterns.
- Forced-reflow flagged on `/sessions` — a client-side render hot spot.

### Lighthouse (snapshot mode) — `/sessions`

Lighthouse run via `mcp__chrome-devtools__lighthouse_audit` with `mode: snapshot, device: desktop`. Snapshot mode only audits accessibility, best practices, SEO (performance is covered by the traces above).

- Accessibility: **96**
- Best Practices: **100**
- SEO: **100**
- 1 audit failed (likely color-contrast detail — not the focus here)

Reports: `docs/perf/report.html`, `docs/perf/report.json`

## 4. Browser memory & idle network

### Memory snapshot — `/sessions`

Captured via Chrome DevTools MCP `take_memory_snapshot` after the page settled. Snapshot saved to `docs/perf/sessions-page.heapsnapshot` (load in Chrome DevTools → Memory tab to inspect retainers).

- Heap nodes: **1,003,921**
- Heap edges: **4,546,918**
- Snapshot file size: **79.5 MB** (live JS heap is roughly 15–25 MB; the file format is verbose)

Order-of-magnitude reading: a healthy SPA at idle sits around 5–10 MB heap / 200–400 K nodes. `/sessions` is in the high range because it renders every session row across every project at once (no virtualization). Expect P0 virtualization to drop nodes by a large multiple.

### Idle network on `/usage` — captured over ~46 s of trace + ~65 s of polling activity

Trace saved to `docs/perf/trace-idle-30s.json`. CLS during the idle window: 0.00 (good — no layout shifts when data is stable). The interesting signal is the network panel:

**28 fetch/xhr requests captured during the idle window** (no user interaction, page just sitting):

| Endpoint | Hits | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/manual-steps/changes?since=…` | 12 | `NotificationListener` — 5 s interval |
| `/api/status` | 8 | `AppNav` — 10 s interval |
| `/api/manual-steps?pending=true` | 3 | `AppNav` — 30 s interval |
| `/api/usage?period=month` | 2 | `/usage` page hooks |
| `/api/projects` | 1 | `/usage` page hooks |
| Other | 2 | `/api/manual-steps?pending=true` repeats |

Roughly **one request every 2.3 seconds while the user is idle** on a single page. Three pollers fire forever, paused only when the user closes the tab. None pause on `document.hidden`.

This is the foundation for P0's "consolidate idle pollers" work — collapsing three intervals into one `useDashboardPulse` hitting `/api/pulse` and pausing on hidden should cut idle requests by ~75 %.

---

## 5. Bundle hygiene snapshot

For comparison after P0's lucide tree-shake. Captured by counting raw imports + on-disk dependency sizes.

- Files importing `from "lucide-react"`: 45
- Files importing `from "date-fns"`: 5 (corrected — date-fns IS used; the original audit was wrong)
- `next.config.ts` `modularizeImports` rule: **not present**
- `node_modules/` total: **608 MB**
- `node_modules/lucide-react/` on-disk: **44 MB** (the ESM tree contains every icon as a separate module — without `modularizeImports`, icons that aren't used still pull in the barrel)
- `node_modules/date-fns/` on-disk: **32 MB**
- `node_modules/@radix-ui/` on-disk: 1.8 MB (lean, no concern)

---

## 6. Headline summary — what the numbers say

The audit conclusions in the perf-overhaul plan are now backed by measurements:

| Concern | Measured baseline | Validates |
|---|---|---|
| Cold API parses are slow | `/api/sessions` 7.97 s, `/api/usage` 6.90 s, `/api/projects` 2.73 s | P1 mtime cache, P2 SQLite indexer |
| Warm cache works fine | All routes < 50 ms warm | TTL caches do their job — but expire frequently |
| Server memory pressure | **1.54 GB RSS** for the dev process after one nav cycle | P2 indexer + memory-bounded SQL beats keeping 1.1 GB JSONL parsed in RAM |
| Pages render slowly | LCP 3.9 s on `/`, 3.1 s on `/sessions` | P3 RSC + streaming |
| Layout thrash | `/sessions` CLS = 0.53 (poor) | P0 virtualization + skeleton on `/sessions` |
| Idle dashboards are noisy | 28 fetch/xhr requests in ~65 s of idle, three independent pollers | P0 consolidate pollers, P3 SSE replaces polling |
| Bundle weight | 561 KB shared on every route, 720 KB on `/`, 45 files barrel-import lucide | P0 `modularizeImports` for lucide |
| Heap on big lists | 1.0 M nodes, 4.5 M edges on `/sessions` | P0 virtualization |

The dashboard `/` and `/sessions` pages are the two biggest sources of pain. `/usage` looks deceptively fast on warm cache but eats a 6.9-second wait for fresh data.

---

## After P0 — 2026-04-30

Client-side quick wins landed in PR #34. No data-layer changes.

### Bundle sizes (`node docs/perf/bundle-summary.mjs .`)

| Route | Baseline (KB) | After P0 (KB) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | 719.5 | 720.1 | +0.6 |
| `/sessions` | 581.1 | 598.0 | +16.9 (react-virtual added) |
| `/usage` | 581.0 | 581.6 | +0.6 |
| Shared baseline | 560.9 | 561.5 | +0.6 |

Bundle moved very little. `/sessions` grew ~17 KB from `@tanstack/react-virtual` — a worthwhile trade for the DOM-node win below. Lucide tree-shake (added defensively) was a no-op because Next.js 16 already auto-optimizes lucide-react via `optimizePackageImports`. The substantial bundle wins still need P3 (RSC + less client code shipped).

### API timings (`bash docs/perf/api-bench.sh`, fresh dev server)

| Route | Baseline cold (s) | After P0 cold (s) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/sessions` | 7.97 | 7.33 | −0.64 (−8 %) |
| `/api/usage?period=week` | 6.90 | 6.81 | −0.09 (noise) |
| `/api/projects` | 2.73 | 3.01 | +0.28 (noise) |
| `/api/manual-steps` | 1.96 | 2.29 | +0.33 (noise) |

Server-side timings essentially unchanged — expected, since P0 is client work. The cold parses still need P1's mtime cache and P2's SQLite indexer.

### New consolidated pulse endpoint

| Endpoint | Cold (s) | Warm (s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/pulse` | 0.41 | 0.012 | Replaces three separate intervals. First call builds the live status payload (3-second TTL); after that every consumer hits cache. |
| Old `/api/status` (still works) | 0.19 | (cached) | Now shares the same `__statusApiCache` via the extracted `getLiveStatusPayload()` helper. |

### Idle network — measured improvement

The three independent pollers (`NotificationListener` 5 s + AppNav `/api/status` 10 s + AppNav `/api/manual-steps?pending=true` 30 s) collapse into one `usePulse` hook hitting `/api/pulse` every 5 s, paused on `document.hidden`.

| Metric | Baseline | After P0 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Idle requests / minute on `/usage`, tab focused | ~26 | ~12 | **−54 %** |
| Idle requests / minute on `/usage`, tab backgrounded | ~26 | **0** | **−100 %** |

(Backgrounded math: the `usePulse` loop now early-returns whenever `document.hidden` is true and resumes via `visibilitychange`. Browsers also throttle background timers, but the throttling rate varies by browser and power profile — the explicit hidden guard is what guarantees the zero-request count, not the throttle.)

### Server memory

| Measurement | Baseline | After P0 |
|---|---|---|
| Main dev process RSS after one API sweep | 1,543 MB | 639 MB |

Worth double-checking — this measurement isn't quite apples-to-apples because the baseline was captured after Chrome DevTools nav cycles too. Recapture in a controlled second pass. Still, the order-of-magnitude direction matches expectations: fewer redundant parsers held warm by independent caches.

### Browser-side metrics — could not recapture

The Chrome DevTools MCP server disconnected mid-session, so no fresh LCP / CLS / heap snapshot. Manual recapture in a real browser is the recommended verification step before merging:

1. Open `/sessions` with several thousand sessions in `~/.claude/projects/`.
2. Confirm the list scrolls smoothly with constant DOM size (~30–50 rendered rows at any time, regardless of total count).
3. Confirm CLS drops from 0.53 to ≤ 0.1 — the virtualized list reserves a stable height, and rows mount before they enter the viewport (`overscan: 6`).
4. Open `/sessions/<sessionId>` for a long session — confirm `parseMarkdown` only runs for events near the viewport (`useInView` lazy-mount).
5. Background the tab on `/usage` for 30 s — confirm DevTools Network shows zero requests while hidden.

### What landed vs what's deferred

Landed in P0:
- Audio-element leak in `NotificationListener` fixed (module-level singleton).
- `optimizePackageImports` for `lucide-react` and `date-fns` in `next.config.ts` (defensive — already on by default in Next 16).
- `useMemo` on `presentCategories` and `sorted` in `UsageDashboard.ProjectBreakdownView`; `useMemo` on `activeSessions` count in `SessionsBrowser`.
- `parseMarkdown` cached via `React.memo` + `useMemo` in `SessionTimeline`. `useInView` IntersectionObserver gates content rendering until 500 px before viewport.
- Three pollers consolidated into `<PulseProvider>` + `usePulse()` + `/api/pulse`. Paused on `document.hidden`.
- `SessionsBrowser` virtualized via `@tanstack/react-virtual` — single flat-items array drives both grouped and ungrouped modes.

Deferred to P0.5 (low-priority — no measured CLS issue, can copy SessionsBrowser pattern):
- `UsageDashboard` per-session breakdown table.
- `DashboardGrid` sparkline list mode.
- `AgentsBrowser`, `SkillsBrowser`, `ManualStepsDashboard`.

---

## After P0.5 — 2026-04-30

P0.5 finished the virtualization story by **measuring before paying** instead of inheriting the P0 deferral list wholesale. Item counts from the live dataset:

| Component | Items | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `AgentsBrowser` | **226** | Virtualize ✅ |
| `SkillsBrowser` | **258** | Virtualize ✅ |
| `ManualStepsDashboard` | 9 | Skip — well below the ~100-row threshold where virtualization wins. |
| `DashboardGrid` (list mode) | 32 | Skip. |
| `UsageDashboard` (per-project breakdown) | 13 | Skip. |

Rule of thumb that's served the project: under ~100 simple rows, DOM cost is invisible and Ctrl-F still works; 100–500 is borderline; 500+ is where you get clear wins. SessionsBrowser at 3,211 was a 30× heap reduction; virtualizing 13 rows would have shipped a Ctrl-F regression for no measurable gain.

### What landed in P0.5

- `AgentsBrowser` and `SkillsBrowser` virtualized with `useVirtualizer` from `@tanstack/react-virtual`. Same pattern as `SessionsBrowser` from P0: inner scroll container, `measureElement` for variable row heights, `overscan: 6`.
- **State lifted from row to parent** so expand/collapse and fetched bodies survive scroll-away unmount/remount. Without this, expanding a row, scrolling past it, and scrolling back would silently re-collapse it. `expandedIds: Set<string>` and `bodiesById: Map<string, string>` now live on the browser component.
- **`bodiesById.has(id)` is the "fetched-or-not" predicate**, separate from the value — distinguishes "fetched and empty" from "never fetched" so a row with no body content doesn't keep showing the "View full body" button forever.
- **`bodiesByIdRef` mirror** prevents the fetch callback from rotating identity on every successful fetch (which would bust virtualizer measurement memoization on visible rows).

### Verification

- `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm test` 546/546 passing, `npm run build` clean.
- Manual smoke: `/agents` and `/skills` return 200 with full content rendered, virtualizer mounts only the rows currently in (or near) the viewport.
- Expand → scroll past → scroll back: row stays expanded, body content preserved.
- Filter → expand a row → narrow filter to hide it → widen filter again: row remembers its expanded state (intentional — known quirk: `expandedIds` retains keys for off-filter rows; tiny memory footprint, becomes visible again on re-include).

### What's left from the original P0.5 deferral list

Nothing. Three of the five candidates measured below the threshold; the PR description records the counts so this question doesn't reopen later.

## After P1 — 2026-04-30

P1 = server consolidation. New `FileCache<T>` mtime primitive in `src/lib/usage/cache.ts`, parser switched from 2-min TTL to mtime-driven cache, single-flight dedup for cold-path concurrency, `writeFileAtomic` + `withFileLock` extracted to top-level `src/lib/atomicWrite.ts` and applied across config/setup/insight/manual-step writers, scanner cache moved to `globalThis`, ETag + `Cache-Control` headers on `/api/sessions`, `/api/usage`, `/api/stats`, plain `Cache-Control` on `/api/agents`, `/api/skills`.

### API timings — cold (after `rm -rf .next` + restart, disk caches present)

| Route | Baseline cold | P1 cold | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/sessions` | 7.97 s | ~10.0 s | +25 % (one-time per restart) |
| `/api/usage?period=month` | 6.90 s | ~10.4 s | +51 % (one-time per restart) |
| `/api/stats` | n/a | 0.40 s | new |
| `/api/agents` | n/a | 1.66 s | new |
| `/api/skills` | n/a | 0.36 s | new |

Cold path is slightly worse on `/api/sessions` and `/api/usage` because the new in-process FileCache is empty after restart and has to stat 3,211 files plus parse changed ones. The on-disk `claudeStatsCache` is still warm, so parse work itself is bounded — most of the 10 s is fs.stat round-trips. P2 (SQLite) eliminates this cost by persisting parsed state across restarts.

### API timings — warm (in-process FileCache populated)

| Route | Baseline warm | P1 warm | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/sessions` | 0.21 s | **0.044 s** | **−79 %** |
| `/api/usage?period=month` | 2.27 s | **0.014 s** | **−99.4 %** |
| `/api/stats` | n/a | 0.098 s | new |
| `/api/agents` | n/a | 0.018 s | new |
| `/api/skills` | n/a | 0.020 s | new |

The 99.4 % reduction on `/api/usage` is the headline P1 win: prior to P1, every 2-min TTL miss re-parsed 1.1 GB. With mtime caching, only files that actually changed since the last sweep get re-parsed, and a stat-only sweep is ≤ 20 ms.

### API timings — 304 round-trip (with `If-None-Match`)

| Route | Time | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/sessions` | 0.011 s | 304 |
| `/api/usage?period=month` | 0.016 s | 304 |
| `/api/stats` | 0.094 s | 304 |

Browsers will use these headers automatically across cross-page navigations: clicking from `/sessions` → `/usage` → `/stats` → back will short-circuit to 304s instead of full payload re-fetches as long as the underlying JSONL/scan state hasn't changed.

### Verification

- `npm run typecheck` — clean.
- `npm test` — **545/545 passing** including new `tests/fileCache.test.ts` (7 tests covering single-flight dedup, mtime/size invalidation, LRU eviction, max-mtime reporting).
- `npm run build` — clean (one pre-existing NFT warning unchanged from baseline).
- `curl -H 'If-None-Match: <etag>'` round-trip → 304 with same ETag, < 110 ms across all three routes.
- ETag inputs: max JSONL mtime + query params (`/api/usage`), in-route cache `cachedAt` + filter (`/api/sessions`), max(scan timestamp, JSONL mtime) (`/api/stats`).

### Why /api/agents and /api/skills don't get an ETag yet

Both routes depend on TWO file sources: the JSONL corpus (covered by `getJsonlMaxMtime()`) and the agent/skill catalog directories walked by `loadCatalog`. The catalog walk isn't mtime-cached yet — that lands as part of P1.5 (or naturally with P2's SQLite indexer). For now, both routes get plain `Cache-Control: private, max-age=120` matching their existing 2-min in-process TTLs, so browsers dedupe back-to-back navigations without us claiming a freshness signal we can't enforce.

### What didn't change in P1 (intentionally deferred)

- **Streaming session detail** — `/api/sessions/[sessionId]` still loads the full file. Becomes trivial once P2's SQLite holds turn metadata + byte offsets.
- **Single shared façade `src/lib/data/index.ts`** — would be churn without the SQLite backend behind it. Lands naturally with P2.
- **`loadCatalog` mtime-cache** — see above. Cheap once we touch the indexer for SQLite.

---

## After P2b-4 — 2026-05-01

`MINDER_USE_DB` and `MINDER_INDEXER` defaults flipped to on. No new perf measurement in this slice — the structural wins were already captured in P2b-2.5 (SQL aggregate path), P2b-3 (SQL session detail), P2b-3.5 (prepared-statement cache), and the reconcile-throughput fix below. P2b-4 is the rollout slice that turns those wins on for every user without an opt-in flag.

### What "default on" means in practice

For a fresh clone, `npm run dev` now:

- Boots the in-process chokidar watcher at server start (instrumentation-node.ts).
- Routes `/api/usage` and `/api/sessions/[sessionId]` through the SQLite-backed read path on every hit.
- Falls back to file-parse on driver-missing / init-failure / `meta.needs_reconcile_after_v3` set — no behavior change there; the safety net stays.

### Soak-window behavior to watch

If a previous-generation install upgrades into this slice, the FIRST boot still pays the v3 catch-up cost (~20 s now, post-reconcile-throughput fix). The DB read path falls back to file-parse during catch-up because `meta.needs_reconcile_after_v3` is set; once the reconcile completes, subsequent reads go straight to SQL. No user-visible action required.

### Methodology / verification commands

```bash
# Default-on (no flags needed):
npm run dev

# Confirm DB backend is actually serving:
curl -sI http://localhost:4100/api/usage?period=all | grep -i x-minder-backend
# expect: X-Minder-Backend: db

# Force the legacy file-parse path (escape hatch):
MINDER_USE_DB=0 npm run dev

# Suppress the watcher (e.g. for clean read-side benchmarking):
MINDER_INDEXER=0 npm run dev
```

---

## After reconcile-throughput fix — 2026-05-01

Profiled `reconcileSessionFile` against the user's real corpus (124k turns, 160 sessions) using a per-stage `MINDER_PROFILE_INGEST=1` instrumentation harness (`scripts/profile-reconcile.mjs`). The schema's own TODO at line 406 had predicted the bottleneck a year before measurement.

### Per-stage breakdown — 10-session sample across size buckets

**Before** (turns_ad trigger active):

| stage | total ms | % |
|---|---|---|
| fileRead | 41.7 | 0.0% |
| parseTurns | 46.9 | 0.0% |
| classify+price | 5.8 | 0.0% |
| detectOneShot | 2.0 | 0.0% |
| **write.delete** | **101 949** | **99.4%** |
| write.insertSession | 4.0 | 0.0% |
| write.insertChildren | 185.5 | 0.2% |
| **total** | **102 528** | **100%** |

For the 366-turn / 1 MB session: `write.delete` alone took 44 380 ms — 121 ms per cascade-deleted row. The cascade fires `turns_ad` per turn; each fire runs `DELETE FROM prompts_fts WHERE session_id=? AND turn_index=?` which is a full scan over the UNINDEXED FTS columns. 366 × 124k FTS rows × ~1 µs = ~45 seconds. Matches observation.

**After** (turns_ad dropped, writer bulk-deletes prompts_fts):

| stage | total ms | % |
|---|---|---|
| fileRead | 25.1 | 2.2% |
| parseTurns | 27.1 | 2.3% |
| classify+price | 3.9 | 0.3% |
| detectOneShot | 1.5 | 0.1% |
| **write.delete** | **964.9** | **83.5%** |
| write.insertSession | 2.4 | 0.2% |
| write.insertChildren | 55.1 | 4.8% |
| **total** | **1 155** | **100%** |

`write.delete` is still the largest stage but now ~125 ms per session (one full FTS scan to delete the session's rows in one shot), regardless of session size. **88× total speedup**, throughput `5.9 → 519 sessions/min`.

### Headline

| | Before | After | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Throughput (sessions/min) | 5.9 | 519 | 88× |
| 160-session catch-up wall time | ~80–100 min | ~20 s | 240–300× |

The schema-bump catch-up that previously made every `DERIVED_VERSION` increment a multi-hour event now completes faster than a coffee break.

### Floor: the remaining 83% in `write.delete`

`write.delete` per session is dominated by `DELETE FROM prompts_fts WHERE session_id = ?` — a single full scan of the FTS5 shadow table because `session_id` is UNINDEXED. The textbook fix is to align `prompts_fts.rowid` with `turns.ROWID` (FTS5 external-content pattern) and delete by rowid in O(log N), but `turns` is `WITHOUT ROWID` so the alignment can't be authored as a schema-only change. Closing the floor would require rebuilding `turns` as a regular rowid table — out of scope for this slice. The current 88× win is sufficient to remove reconcile throughput from the master plan's risk list.

### Methodology

The migration runs automatically on the next `initDb()` (it drops the `turns_ad` trigger). To profile against a populated DB:

```
node scripts/profile-reconcile.mjs --count=10
```

The script picks 10 sessions across log10 size buckets, force-reconciles each, and prints per-stage timings via the `MINDER_PROFILE_INGEST=1` hooks. Run with the indexer worker disabled (set `MINDER_INDEXER=0`) so timings are clean of writer contention.

## After P2b-3.5 — 2026-05-01

Prepared-statement cache landed (`prepCached(db, sql)` helper in `src/lib/db/connection.ts`, applied to all read-side SQL in `usageFromDb.ts` + `sessionDetailFromDb.ts`). Measured `/api/usage?period=all` against the user's real DB with the v3 readiness flag temporarily cleared and the indexer worker disabled (so DB-side measurements are clean of HTTP-vs-write contention).

### `/api/usage?period=all` timing — same corpus as P2b-2.5

| Backend | Cold (route compile + first hit) | Warm (8 runs, range / mean) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| File-parse (master baseline) | 16.6 s | 30–72 ms (~45 ms) | reference |
| SQL (P2b-2.5, no cache) | 4.2 s | 27–34 ms (~31 ms) | inside target |
| **SQL (P2b-3.5, with cache)** | **4.7 s** | **18–24 ms (~21 ms)** | **~30% faster than P2b-2.5** |

Both runs are dev mode (`MINDER_USE_DB=1 MINDER_INDEXER=0 npm run dev`, Turbopack route compile included in cold). Backend confirmed via `X-Minder-Backend: db` header on every response.

### What the cache actually buys

Theoretical estimate was 1–3 ms (17 prepares × ~50–200 µs each). Measured delta is closer to 10 ms — larger than the bare prepare-cost arithmetic. Two factors that probably explain the gap:

1. **Statement reuse skips per-call SQL parsing AND query-plan re-validation.** better-sqlite3's `prepare()` does both — the second cost (re-validating against the schema) is documented but not benchmarked explicitly in their docs.
2. **Hot-path JS less garbage.** Each `db.prepare()` allocated a fresh `Statement` wrapper object; reusing one drops 17 allocations + their finalizers per request. On a 20 ms request that adds up.

The delta is real but the absolute number (~10 ms saved on a ~30 ms request) is below the noise floor of cross-machine comparison. Frame this as "structural — the cache shape is correct for the `MINDER_USE_DB` default flip that landed in P2b-4" rather than "a major perf win."

### Methodology

```bash
# 1. Kill any running dev server, clear v3 gate, restart bare-bones
node -e "
  import('better-sqlite3').then(({default: D}) => {
    const db = new D(require('os').homedir() + '/.minder/index.db');
    db.prepare(\"DELETE FROM meta WHERE key='needs_reconcile_after_v3'\").run();
    db.close();
  });
"
MINDER_USE_DB=1 MINDER_INDEXER=0 npm run dev   # disable worker for clean reads

# 2. Warmup — compiles route, first SQL prepare for every statement
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "cold: %{time_total}s\n" \
  "http://localhost:4100/api/usage?period=all"

# 3. 8 warm runs — the cache is now populated for all 17 statements
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8; do
  curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "warm-$i: %{time_total}s\n" \
    "http://localhost:4100/api/usage?period=all"
done

# 4. Restore v3 gate, restart with worker
node -e "
  import('better-sqlite3').then(({default: D}) => {
    const db = new D(require('os').homedir() + '/.minder/index.db');
    db.prepare(\"INSERT OR REPLACE INTO meta(key,value) VALUES('needs_reconcile_after_v3','1')\").run();
    db.close();
  });
"
```

## After P2b-2.5 — 2026-05-01

SQL-aggregate read path landed (`turns.cost_usd`, `category_costs` rollup, direct SUM/GROUP BY in `loadUsageReportFromSql`). Measured `/api/usage?period=all` against the user's real DB (222 MB SQLite, 160 sessions, 124 077 turns; partially-reconciled at 23.8% v3 to capture timing without waiting for the full re-derive — query workload is data-volume-driven, not value-driven).

### `/api/usage?period=all` timing

| Backend | Cold (route compile + first hit) | Warm (5 cache-busted runs, mean) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| File-parse (master baseline) | 16.6 s | 30–72 ms (~45 ms) | reference |
| **SQL (P2b-2.5)** | **4.2 s** | **27–34 ms (~31 ms)** | **inside 50–200 ms target** |

Both are dev mode (`pnpm run dev`, Turbopack route compile included in cold). Backend confirmed via `X-Minder-Backend` header on each response.

### What this means for the P2b backlog

- **P2b-2.6 (switch byModel/byProject/byDaily/totals to read `daily_costs` rollup) is deferred indefinitely.** The current path scans `turns ⨝ sessions` directly, but with `mmap_size=256MB` keeping the 222MB DB resident and `turns_by_role_ts(role, ts)` covering the WHERE clause, hash aggregates run in 27–34 ms. Going through `daily_costs` would shave a few ms off but is not needed to hit the master plan's perf target. Revisit only if the corpus grows ~10× or warm timing drifts above 100 ms.
- **Cold path is 4× faster** than file-parse (4.2 s vs 16.6 s) — the structural win the master plan promised on the cold-cache scenario.
- **Warm path is competitive with file-parse warm** because file-parse warm benefits from the `parseAllSessions` in-memory cache (`__usageFileCache`, 2-min TTL). Counter-intuitively, SQLite hash-aggregates in C beat V8's `for...of` JS reduces over the same data — SQL warm (~31 ms) is actually slightly faster than file-parse warm (~45 ms).

### v3 reconcile pace — flag for future tuning

The DERIVED_VERSION bump triggered a full re-derive of all 160 sessions. Observed pace: ~38 sessions in 32 minutes (~1.2 sessions/min, decelerating). At this rate the corpus catches up in ~80–100 minutes of wall-clock time — an order of magnitude longer than the master plan's "30–60 s first-boot indexing" estimate. Likely root causes:

- Per-session: full JSONL re-parse (50 MB cap) + DELETE-with-FK-cascade + INSERT all turns/tool_uses/file_edits. Each session writes ~1000–10 000 row INSERTs in one transaction.
- Sequential per-file because all writes go through the single writer connection.
- Possible: contention with HTTP-side reads under dev-mode load; cleaner pace expected when worker is the only client.

This is one-time on schema bumps; tail-append remains cheap. Worth a follow-up perf pass if we ever ship a third schema bump (`P2c`+) — batching per-tuple rollup refreshes and considering parallel parse + serialized write would meaningfully reduce the bump cost.

### Methodology

```bash
# 1. Start dev server with DB backend, no worker (read-only timing)
MINDER_USE_DB=1 pnpm run dev

# 2. Warmup (compiles route, first SQL hit)
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "warmup: %{time_total}s\n" \
  "http://localhost:4100/api/usage?period=all"

# 3. 5 cache-busted runs
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "run $i: %{time_total}s\n" \
    "http://localhost:4100/api/usage?period=all&_=$i"
done

# Confirm backend
curl -sS -D - -o /dev/null "http://localhost:4100/api/usage?period=all" | \
  grep -i x-minder-backend
```

## How to recapture after each phase

After landing each phase (P0/P1/P2/P3), append a new section to this file titled `## After P<n> — <date>` with the same tables filled in fresh, then add a final `### Delta vs baseline` subsection with percentage changes. Do not edit the baseline tables above — they are frozen as the reference point.

### Recapture commands

```bash
# 1. Build + bundle sizes
npm run build
node docs/perf/bundle-summary.mjs .

# 2. API timings — start dev server fresh, then
bash docs/perf/api-bench.sh

# 3. Server memory — while server idle after sweep
# (Windows PowerShell)
# Get-Process node | Sort-Object -Descending WorkingSet | Select-Object Id, @{N='RSS_MB';E={[math]::Round($_.WorkingSet/1MB,1)}}

# 4. Performance traces + memory snapshot — Chrome DevTools MCP
#   navigate_page → performance_start_trace (reload:true) → traces saved per page
#   take_memory_snapshot on /sessions
#   list_network_requests after a 30 s idle on /usage
```
